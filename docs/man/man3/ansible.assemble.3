assemble \- Assembles a configuration file from fragments
." ------ DESCRIPTION
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Assembles a configuration file from fragments. Often a particular program will take a single configuration file and does not support a \fCconf.d\fR style structure where it is easy to build up the configuration from multiple sources. \fIassemble\fR will take a directory of files that have already been transferred to the system, and concatenate them together to produce a destination file. Files are assembled in string sorting order. Puppet calls this idea \fIfragments\fR.
