.SH NAME
command \- Executes a command on a remote node
." ------ DESCRIPTION
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fIcommand\fR module takes the command name followed by a list of space-delimited arguments. 
.PP
The given command will be executed on all selected nodes. It will not be processed through the shell, so variables like \fC$HOME\fR and operations like \fC"<"\fR, \fC">"\fR, \fC"|"\fR, and \fC"&"\fR will not work. As such, all paths to commands must be fully qualified 
." ------ OPTIONS
."
."
.SH OPTIONS
   
.IP chdir

.IP creates
a filename, when it already exists, this step will \fBnot\fR be run.   
.IP executable
change the shell used to execute the command. Should be an absolute path to the executable.(Added in Ansible version 0.9.)
   
.IP free_form

." ------ NOTES
.SH NOTES
.PP
If you want to run a command through the shell (say you are using \fC<\fR, \fC>\fR, \fC|\fR, etc), you actually want the \fIshell\fR module instead. The \fIcommand\fR module is much more secure as it's not affected by the user's environment.

." ------ EXAMPLES
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Example from Ansible Playbooks

.nf
command: /sbin/shutdown -t now
.fi
.PP
\fCcreates\fR, \fCremoves\fR, and \fCchdir\fR can be specified after the command. For instance, if you only want to run a command if a certain file does not exist, use this.

.nf
command: /usr/bin/make_database.sh arg1 arg2 creates=/path/to/database
.fi
